# Paper tasks

## 1. Writing intro

## 2. Writing sections 2 and 3. 
- These should provide concise descriptions of the modeling and data inputs, explicitly provide sufficient information for the experienced reader, but also cite liberally to avoid becoming too long.

## 3. Section 4.1
- Decide on the four galaxy bias models, including priors on b_2 (don't have to be final).
- Decide on informative cosmological parameter priors.
- Decide on 1-loop inputs for validating linear bias model.
- Decide on models for bias evolution within a lens bin for validation of all bias models.
- Decide on two sets of scale cuts. 4,4 and 8,8 until there's some compelling reason to use something else?
- Given the above, set up necessary ini files and run simulated likelihood chains for lcdm and wcdm

# 4. Section 4.2
- Set up Buzzard ini files.
- Investigate to what extent we need to run on every Buzzard realization, rather than just the mean.

# 5. Section 5.2
- Decide on consistency metric for combination with Planck. Niall proposes suspicousness <= 3\sigma?
