% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We present cosmological constraints from the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the DES Y3 data. We describe our modeling framework and choice of scales, validating their robustness to small-scale theoretical uncertainties by analysing simulated data. We implement nonlinear bias models that include parameterizations based on Lagrangian perturbation theory. We present cosmological constraints when using various (coupled) choices of scale cuts and bias models and demonstrate stability of the constraints. We reproduce the baseline choices of the 3x2 cosmology paper, and consider additional choices that make use of small scale information.  Combining with external datasets including Planck, we show constraints on w, as well as higher order galaxy bias parameters

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item LSS can tell us about dark energy.
    \item Galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing is a good combo for probing LSS.
    \item Modeling galaxy bias is the main theoretical challenge for this.
\end{itemize}

\section{Statistics and theory}

\subsection{Two-point statistics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the statistics we use, \wtheta\ and \gammat.
    \item Show their relation to the underlying 3d correlation functions $\xigg(r)$ and $\xigm(r)$
\end{itemize}

\brown{Using the catalog of the positions of foreground lens galaxies and the catalog of shape and positions of background source galaxies, one can construct three two point summary statistics. The two point auto-correlation of the positions of lens galaxies (galaxy clustering), auto-correlation of the lensing shear estimated from shape of background source galaxies (cosmic shear) and  cross-correlation of this lensing shear field and position of lens galaxies (galaxy-galaxy lensing). 

For the galaxy clustering we use the $w(\theta)$ statistic which quantifies the average excess number of galaxy pairs at a separation $\theta$ over a random distribution. For galaxy-galaxy lensing, we use the statistic of $\gamma_{\rm t}(\theta)$ that describes the average tangential component of the shear with respect to the lens-source separation direction. For cosmic shear, which is a spin-2 field, we use the statistic of $\xi_{+}$ and $\xi_{-}$. }


\subsection{P(k) predictions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Heavily referencing the 3D bias paper, describe range of perturbation theory models for $\xigg(r)$ and $\xigm(r)$ and their expected scales of applicability. 
    \item To aid discussion, include some plots showing the sensitivity of our statistics to scales in $\xigg(r)$ and $\xigm(r)$.
    
    \brown{As we saw in the previous section, the statistics of our main interest here $w(\theta)$ and $\gammat$ is related to the underlying 3D correlation functions \xigg and \xigm respectively. }
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The rest of the model}
Describe the rest of the modelling framework:
\begin{itemize}
    \item IAs (NLA)\brown{TATT?}
    \brown{Galaxy galaxy lensing aims to isolate the percent-level coherent shape distortions, or shear, of background source galaxies due to graviataional field of foreground lens galaxies. However, the local environment can align the source galaxies as well as also contribute to the shear signal through lensing distortions. Since this interaction between the source galaxies and their local environment is non-random, it has non-zero contribution to the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal which we need to model. In this analysis we follow the mixed alignment methodolgy of \cite{Blazek_2019}. }
    \item Magnification
    \brown{All the matter between observed galaxy and the observer acts as a gravitational lens. Hence the galaxies get magnified which results in an increase in the size of galaxy images as well as increase in their total flux. The increase in the size of galaxies results in decrease in observed number density (due to stretching of local sky), whereas due to increase in total flux results in increase in number density (as intrinsically fainter galaxies, which are more numerous, can be observed).  }
    \item RSD
    \brown{}
\end{itemize}    

    
    \SP{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Point-mass marginalization 
    \item  Motivate that we will be using the $\Sigma^{-1}_{\rm crit}$ factors when doing the PM marginalization. 
    \item \textbf{\textit{Figure}} Plot comparing the contours with vs without PM marginalization for both 2x2pt and 3x2pt. Make (or show) the argument that it is because of breaking of degeneracy between PM and S8. Basically make the case that PM does not matter for 3x2pt and that 2x2pt can have more aggressive scale cuts than 3x2pt analysis.
    \end{itemize}
    }
    
        
    \brown{The galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is related to the mass density of lenses by:
    \begin{equation}
        \gamma_{\rm t}(R;z_{\rm l},z_{\rm s}) = \frac{\Delta \Sigma (R;z_{\rm l})}{\Sigma_{\rm crit} (z_{\rm l},z_{\rm s})},
    \end{equation}
    where, $\Delta \Sigma(R;z_{\rm l}) = \bar{\Sigma}(0,R; z_{\rm l}) - \Sigma(R;z_{\rm l})$ and $\Sigma(R;z_{\rm l})$ is the surface mass density at a transverse separation $R$ from the lens at redshift $z_{\rm l}$ and $\bar{\Sigma}(0,R)$ is the average surface mass density within a separation $R$ from that lens. Through $\bar{\Sigma}(0,R)$ term, $\gamma_{\rm t}$  at any scale $R$, is dependent on mass distribution at all scales less than $R$. This makes $\gamma_{\rm t}$ statistic highly non-local and any model that is valid only on large scales above some $r_{\rm min}$ (like PT) will break down more rapidly than for a more local statistic like \wtheta. However, as the dependence on small scales is through the \textit{mean} surface mass density, the impact of mass distribution inside $r_{\rm min}$ on \gammat can be written as:
    \begin{equation}
        \gamma_{\rm t}(R;z_{\rm l},z_{\rm s}) = \frac{1}{\Sigma_{\rm crit}(z_{\rm l},z_{\rm s})} \bigg(\Delta \Sigma^{\rm model}(z_{\rm l}) + \frac{B(z_{\rm l})}{R^2} \bigg),
    \end{equation}
    where, $\Delta \Sigma^{\rm model}$ is the prediction from a model that is valid of scales above $r_{\rm min}$ and $B$ is the effective total mass below $r_{\rm min}$.  The average $\gamma_{\rm t}$ signal between lens bin $i$ and source bin $j$ can be written as:
    \begin{equation}
        \gamma_{{\rm t},ij} = \gamma^{\rm model}_{{\rm t},ij} + C_{ij}/\theta^2,
    \end{equation}
    where,
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:pm_Cij}
        C_{ij} = \int dz_{\rm l} \ dz_{\rm s} \ n_{{\rm l},i} \ n_{{\rm s},j} \ B_i(z_{\rm l}) \ \Sigma^{-1}_{\rm crit}(z_{\rm l},z_{\rm s}) \ \chi^{-2}(z_{\rm l}).
    \end{equation}
    Here $B_i$ is the PM for lens bin $i$, $n_{{\rm l},i}$ is the redshift distribution of lenses for tomographic bin $i$, $n_{{\rm s},j}$ is the redshift distribution of sources for tomographic bin $j$ and $chi(z_{\rm l})$ is the comoving distance to lens redshift $z_{\rm l}$. We find that for tomographic bins of our lens sample, we can make the approximation that PM evolves slowly with redshift and hence take $B_i$ out of the double integral in Eq.~\ref{eq:pm_Cij}. Therefore, in our fiducial analysis, we treat the parameters $B_i$ as a constant to marginalize over for any lens bin $i$ and is independent of the redshift distribution of sources. 
    }
    

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shear-ratio information
    \brown{As we are using }
    \item projection of $P(k)$s to $C_l$ and conversion of $C_l$s to $w(\theta),\gamma_t(\theta)$.

\section{The datavector}
We describe the Y3 2x2pt datavector (and it's input data).

The n(z)'s are comapred in the Fig.~\ref{fig:nz_comp}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,draft]{figs/temp.png}
\caption[]{Comparison of n(z)'s of sources and lenses in the data and in the \buzzard/\mice simulation. }
\label{fig:nz_comp}
\end{figure}

The datavectors, along with the best-fit theory models, for both the simulations and DES data are shown in the Appendix~\ref{app:2x2pt_measure}. 

\section{Validation of parameter inference}

\subsection{Models, scale cuts, priors and external datasets}
We describe the models, scale cuts, priors and external datasets we'll use.

\subsubsection{DES 2 $\times$ 2pt models + priors}
For DES 2x2pt, we test 3 different galaxy bias model + prior choices:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Linear bias
    \item 1-loop with a free $-5<b_2<5$ for each lens bin, and $b_s, b_{3nl}$ fixed to co-evolution Lagrangian values.
    \item Free $-5<b_2<5, -5<b_s<5, -5<b_{3nl}<5$ ($b_k$?).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Scale cuts}
Motivated by the 3D bias modelling paper, we choose 2 or 3 sets of scale cuts.

\subsection{Cosmological models, external datasets and priors}
We test the following cosmological model and prior combinations
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Flat \lcdm\ with uninformative priors
    \item Flat \lcdm\ with informative priors on some combination of $\Omega_m$, $H_0$ and $n_s$ TBD.
    \item Flat \wcdm 
    \item Flat \wcdm\ with Planck.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Simulated Likelihood tests}\label{sec:simlike_analysis}


We perform simulated likelihood tests to reveal which of our analysis choice combinations (i.e. scale cuts + bias model + priors + external dataset + cosmological model) return unbiased cosmological parameters.

\brown{Our baseline case assumes linear galaxy biasing and no baryon impact on the matter-matter autopower spectrum. The linear bias values that we use for the five lens bins are $b_1 = 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 2.0$ and  $2.0$  respectively. We compare the cosmology constraints from the baseline datavector with a simulated datavector having contamination from higher order non-linearities. The contaminated datavector receives contribution from non-linear bias and baryonic physics. For non-linear bias we use the Model-X with non-zero $b_2, b_s$ and $b_{\rm 3nl}$ terms. The value of $b_2$ used in the contaminated datavector is given by the $b_1-b_2$ relation extracted from 3D tests in \mice simulations (see Fig.X of 3D draft) at above mentioned $b_1$ for each tomographic bin. We also fix the bias parameters $b_s$ and $b_{\rm 3nl}$ to their co-evolution values. For capturing the impact of baryons on the matter-matter power spectra, we use the feedback model of OWLS-AGN.  }

\SP{\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Figure}} Linear bias recovering unbiased cosmology (for $\Lambda$CDM) at Scale Cut (X,Y) Mpc/$h$. Show contours also for one scale cut smaller and one scale cut bigger than this. 
    \item \textbf{\textit{Figure}} Linear bias $w$CDM: Show results for $w$CDM with and without Planck
    \item \textbf{\textit{Figure}} Non-linear bias $\Lambda$CDM: Show the results for non-linear bias LCDM recovering true cosmology when the input bs and b3nl are not given by co-evolution relation but model uses those relations.
\end{itemize}
}

For each scale cut for (\wtheta,\gammat) as indicated on the y-axis labels, we compare the recovered cosmological  constraints for the contaminated datavector and baseline datavector (with zero contamination). There are residual biases in both $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ even in baseline case (due to projection effects, see \S\ref{sec:simlike_analysis} and Appendix \ref{app:projection_effects}), the difference between constraints from the baseline and contaminated datavector gets larger as we go down in scale cuts along y-axis. We use the criterion of difference between contaminated and baseline being greater than X$\sigma$, to choose our fiducial scale cuts for the linear bias model as (X,Y)Mpc/$h$.    }

This will validate our fiducial non-linear bias model from a simulated likelihood method. }

\subsection{Results on Buzzard simulations}

For those analysis choice combos passing the simulated likelihood tests, we validate on the suite of Y3 buzzard simulations. Select analysis choice combinations that return unbiased cosmological parameters to run on the data. 

\subsubsection{DES-only \lcdm}

We show constraints with two sets of scale cuts: 4,4 and 8,6. In each panel we show constraints for linear and non-linear galaxy bias models. Comment on which of the options give unbiased cosmology. Use this figure to set the scale cuts for non-linear bias model as well.  }

In \fig{fig:bcc_des_lcdm} we show the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ from the mean (over all N realizations) Buzzard 2x2pt measurements, with cosmological parameter priors set I (i.e. wide, ~uninformative priors) in the top panels, and set II in the bottom panels. We show constraints with two sets of scale cuts: 4,4 (left panels) and 8,8 (right panels). In each panel we show constraints for all galaxy bias models (i)-(iv).

In \fig{fig:bcc_des_wcdm} we show the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $w$ from the Buzzard 2x2pt measurements, and also simualted Planck CMB data (simulated at the Buzzard cosmology). We use only cosmological prior set I here (but now with free $w$). There'll be a plot for each choice bias model.

\subsection{Point mass marginalization}
\begin{figure}
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/compare_cosmo_pm_signal_loss_88.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/PM_contribution_radial.pdf}
\caption[]{We show the contribution of the PM to the galaxy-matter correlation in different radial regimes. The input is a halo-matter correlation function generated for a halo mass of $2.5 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}/h$ using the NFW profile in the 1-halo regime ($r < 0.5 Mpc/h$) and 1Loop PT in the 2-halo regime ($r > 0.5 Mpc/h$). The model curve is generated from parameters within 1$\sigma$ of the truth. We show the contribution of the PM term separately for the 1-halo  and 2-halo regimes (up to the scale cut of 8Mpc/$h$). We find that the 2-halo regime contributes significantly. Therefore to put informative prior on the PM, the exact dependence of PM on cosmology and bias has to be known. 
% how that to put the prior on the PM, one needs to know the dependence of PM on all the cosmology/bias parameters to high accuracy in order to put informative priors that will lead to gain in constraining power.
